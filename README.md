## What you can do:
The available options are:
1. PDF tranfer;
2. DOCX transfer;
3. TXT tranfer;
4. ZIP transfer

The readed paths available are "Documents" and "Downloads", the mainly paths where I store all of my documents and dowloads randomly.

The PDF, DOCX, TXT and ZIP transfer for a while, move the files to the following directory `PythonMover\PDF`, `PythonMover\DOCX`, `PythonMover\TXT` and `PythonMover\ZIP`.

## Future Updates:
1. Would be possible to move files to more locations;
2. User Interface will be adapting for a new GUI Interface;
3. Possibility of all directories being created or not, and then choose those directories to move other files.
