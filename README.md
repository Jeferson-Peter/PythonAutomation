# PythonAutomation
> In this project I'm focusing on develop a simple python automation, where I can
> Transfer files in an easy way. I have thought on developing this project, because I almost all of the

##What you can do:
The available options are:
1. PDF tranfer;
2. DOCX transfer;
3. TXT tranfer;

The readed paths available are "Documents" and "Downloads", the mainly paths where I store all of my documents and dowloads randomly.

The PDF, DOCX, and TXT transfer for a while, move the files to the following directory `Documentos\PDF`, `Documentos\DOCX` and `Documentos\TXT`.

## Future Updates:
1. Would be possible to move files to more locations;
2. User Interface will be adapting for a new look;
3. Possibility of the whole directories being possible to create new ones, and then took that directories to move other files.
